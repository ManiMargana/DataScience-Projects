There are two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde wine. 

For more details, consult the reference (Cortezet al., 2009]. Due to privacy and logistic issues, 

only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available 

(e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).


Objective of this project is-

1. Load the data

2. Clean the data

3. Split the data

4. Train the model

5. Save the model (in pickle file)
