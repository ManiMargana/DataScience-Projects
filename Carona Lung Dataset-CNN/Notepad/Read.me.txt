objective

To perform

1. Take the data with the help of OPENCV

2.Use Tensorflow and Keras for building the model

3.Save the weight file 

4. Plot the loss and accuracy graphs

5. Load the weight test on new data or unknown data

Hey this is best project to know about the data science computer vision tech build a model using CNN and Test them



1. You are going to have dataset with effected and not effected images

2 Data [Folder]

1. Effected

2. Not effected
